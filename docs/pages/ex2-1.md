title: The Maybe Type
---

You may have noticed that MCPrelude doesn't have the Maybe type or anything
from Data.Maybe.  That's because you're going to build it all yourself.

**IMPORTANT**
Again, it is imperative that you DO NOT CHEAT.  Don't look at any of the Maybe
stuff from Prelude or Data.Maybe.  Don't do it.  Nobody is forcing you to do
these exercises, so you should try to get the maximum possible benefit.
**IMPORTANT**

First of all, you need to define the Maybe type. It should be able to represent
any value a, as well as the case where no a value exists. This type needs to
represent failing values of any type, so it needs a type variable similar to
what we saw in the Gen type synonym. But this can't be a type synonym because it
has two constructors. Write this type yourself and get it to compile. Once
you've gotten it compiling, check your answer by hex decoding the following:

    64617461204D617962652061203D204E6F7468696E67207C204A7573742061

You should use this definition and names going forward.  We just wanted you to
work on it yourself first.

Then for convenience write a Show instance for this new type.

    instance Show a => Show (Maybe a) where

If you're having trouble with this, here is the hex encoded instance.

    202073686F77204E6F7468696E67203D20224E6F7468696E6722DA202073686F7720284A757374206129203D20224A7573742022202B2B2073686F772061

On the other hand, if writing this instance was too difficult, it might be
good to go study some more introductory Haskell materials before continuing
here.
