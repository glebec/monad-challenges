title: Tailprod
---

Write a function that takes the product of the tail of a list.  Use your
tailMay function and the product function defined in the prelude.  This
function should return `Nothing` when passed an empty list,  `Just 1` when
passed a list of one element (which is what the Prelude's product function
does), and return the product of the tail for larger lists.

    tailProd :: Num a => [a] -> Maybe a

Now write a similar but slightly different function:

    tailSum :: Num a => [a] -> Maybe a

These two functions have a lot in common.  See if you can abstract out the
commonality.  To do this, write another function called transMaybe that is the
generalized version of both of these.  Spend some time working on this before
you look at the next hint:

Write a function with that type signature and then go back and implement
tailProd and tailSum in terms of that function.

Now that you have that finished, use transMaybe again to write two more
functions tailMax and tailMin. These functions will have different type
signatures than tailProd and tailSum. See if you can figure out what they should
be. If you can't figure it out, here's one.

That type signature is different from the ones above for tailProd and tailSum
and less convenient to use. To collapse the two levels you'll need another
helper function. See if you can figure out what the type signature of this
function should be and how to implement it. Call this function `combine`. Here
is its hex encoded type signature if you need help.
