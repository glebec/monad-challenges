title: A Missed Generalization
---

We just found an equivalence between generalB and yLink. In Set 2 we implemented
yLink in terms of link without using any cases. But in Set 1 you might not have
implemented generalB in terms of genTwo. Go back and look at your generalB
implementation and if you didn't write it in terms of genTwo, do that now and
call it generalB2. Doing this should get rid of the state threading between
generators.

Re-implement repRandom in terms of generalA, genTwo, and
mkGen. Note that by using generalA, genTwo and mkGen you
should not need to have a `seed` variable in your code for repRandom anywhere.
