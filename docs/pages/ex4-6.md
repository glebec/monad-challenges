title: Using the abstraction
---

Now your Set4.hs module has fairly decent set of abstract tools all built on
the Monad interface. Now go back through sets 1, 2, and 3 and redo them all
using the library of functions you built up in Set4.hs. Since `Gen` is now a
newtype you will have to make some changes to the functions that use it.  This
may seem like a waste of time, but it will develop your familiarity with the
names actually used by Haskell's monad library. This is the core of developing
a working knowledge of monads. The first three sets were the motivation. Now
we're getting to the real world use.
