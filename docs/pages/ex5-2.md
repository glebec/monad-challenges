title: Do Notation â€“ operators
---

In the last exercise, we noted that the following code:

    rule1 = do
        foo <- calcFoo
        bar foo

Is automatically de-sugared to:

    rule1 = bind calcFoo (\foo -> bar foo)

In Haskell, the `bind` function is conventionally written as the `>>=`
operator, which can be written infix style like this:

    rule1 = calcFoo >>= (\foo -> bar foo)

In order for the do syntax to work correctly, we need to change our Monad class
to have a >>= operator. Create a class like this:

    class Monad m where
        (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
        return :: a -> m a

        fail :: String -> m a
        fail = undefined

(Note: for historical reasons, `Monad` is required to have a `fail` function. We
will not be concerning ourselves with failure here, so we just leave this as undefined.
When you implement Monad for your own data types, you should only implement the >>= and
return functions)

In the next few sections, we will be rewriting the earlier exercises using do syntax.
