title: Do Notation â€“  Set 1
---

First, create an instance of monad for your `Gen` new type, similar to what you did in Set 4.
You will also probably want to create an `evalGen :: Gen a -> Seed -> a` function as well.

With your monad instance, you should be able to use do syntax. Recall that in Set 1 we had
a function called `rand :: Seed -> (Integer, Seed)`. Create a new function
`makeRandom :: Gen Integer` which wraps the rand function inside your new type.

Next, use do syntax to re-create the following function from Set 1:

    fiveRands :: Gen [Integer]

To check that you created this function correctly, recall that the product of the five numbers
you generate when passing in a seed of `mkSeed 1` is 8681089573064486461641871805074254223660.

Once that has been created correctly, create `randLetter :: Gen Char` and use it to create
`randString3 :: Gen String`, which creates a string of three random characters. If you have an initial seed of 1, when you use [this site](http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator) to
calculate the SHA-256 hash of the output of randString3, you get
9d475eb78d3e38085220ed6ebde9d8f7d26540bb1c8f9382479c3acd4c8c94a3.

Lastly, go ahead and create this general function:

    generalPair :: Gen a -> Gen b -> Gen (a, b)
