title: Do Notation â€“  Set 2
---

As with the previous set, you will want to create a Monad instance for your Maybe data type.

Once that is accomplished, rewrite the following functions using do syntax:

    queryGreek :: GreekData -> String -> Maybe Double
    addSalaries :: [(String, Integer)] -> String -> String -> Maybe Integer
    tailProd :: Num a => [a] -> Maybe a
    tailSum :: Num a => [a] -> Maybe a
    tailMax :: Ord a => [a] -> Maybe a

You should import Set2 so that you can use the helper functions you wrote in that set.

You can test queryGreek with the following assertions:

    queryGreek greekDataA "alpha" == Just 2.0
    queryGreek greekDataA "beta" == Nothing
    queryGreek greekDataA "gamma" == Just 3.3333333333333335
    queryGreek greekDataA "delta" == Nothing
    queryGreek greekDataA "zeta" == Nothing

    queryGreek greekDataB "rho" == Nothing
    queryGreek greekDataB "phi" == Just 0.24528301886792453
    queryGreek greekDataB "chi" == Just 9.095238095238095
    queryGreek greekDataB "psi" == Nothing
    queryGreek greekDataB "omega" == Just 24.0
